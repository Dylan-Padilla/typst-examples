= Introduction
"Free Software" means software that respects users' freedom and community. Roughly, it means that the users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, and improve the software. Thus, "free software" is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand the concept, please watch the series of YouTube shorts that the ASN Graduate Council is making. We hope you enjoy them.
